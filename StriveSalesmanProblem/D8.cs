    Module 9 - Day 8 KnapSack

    # Implement your own version of 0/1 KnapSack  #
    
    Given a list of objects, with a Weight and a Value, and a maximum capacity of your "bag", decide what items you should pick.

    We don't need extra optimization, a simple solution could be:

    1) Generate all the possible combinations of items.
    2) Calculate cost of every permutation and keep track of minimum cost permutation.
    3) Return the permutation with minimum cost.

    Capacity: 100
    Example Items (weight, value):
    - W: 5, V: 5
    - W: 20, V: 15
    - W: 50, V: 76
    - W: 100, V: 80
    - W: 1, V: 2
    - W: 14, V: 20
    - W: 11, V: 11
    - W: 25, V: 30


    <IMPORTANT> Don't Google / search for solutions out there. 
    Use your own skills to find a solution for the problem.
    It could be a "not performant" or "ugly" solution but at least it will be YOUR OWN solution.
    No dynamic programming solutions </IMPORTANT>

    <IMPORTANT> Try your solution on smaller subsets.  </IMPORTANT>
